using &&boperator in Adhar2.jsx

1. The && (logical) operator in React is commonly
used for conditional rendering. It allows you to render
a componemt or element only if a certain conditional is met.

Basic syntax in Javascript
The && operator works as follows:

If the left-hand side condition is true, the right-hand side expression is returned.
If the left-hand side condition is false, nothing (or false) is returned.

console.log(true && "Hello")
console.log(false && "Hello")

&& is useful for conditionally rendering UI elements only if a condition is true.
Be careful with falsy value (0, "", null, undefined, false)
If you need an else case, use the ternary operator (? :) instead.

// There are 2 cases

1. If there is a condition you want to check and send response according to that 
condition then use ternary operator

2. If there is a condition or value which you want to show only if its There
and dont show if its ot there then use && operator
